Benefits 
<font size="4" color="#111F25 "/>1. For the Economy, Business, and Industries.
Artificial intelligence can benefit the economy by helping the evolution of work. Robots and AI will help people perform their tasks better, not take their jobs. The combination of man and machine will be unstoppable.

With deep learning and machine learning, AI can become smarter over time, thus increasing a business' efficiency. AI will also significantly reduce the probability of human error and study historical data to cut costs.

Facial recognition, pattern identification, and digital content analysis will be huge. Academic research, health sciences, and tech companies will enjoy enhanced capabilities.

2. For Humanity and Society
AI enhances information throughput and efficiency, helping people create new opportunities. We're talking about new streams for revenue generation, savings, and jobs.

Artificial intelligence enhances users' lifestyle choices by using search algorithms that provide targeted information. AI will handle all mundane tasks, such as data entry and answering emails. AI-powered smart homes can cut down on energy use and provide better security.

Throughout the history of humanity, the improvement of technology has resulted in the elevation of the human condition. Think of electricity in homes and the automobile. AI has the potential to eclipse these because machines will be able to help people solve more significant, more complicated social problems. Innovation will reign, and quality of life will get better.

Artificial intelligence can significantly expand human creativity and ingenuity by handling tedious tasks. People will have more time to learn, experiment and explore.

3. For Health care and Medicine Health care services will be better at diagnostics because an AI wearable can monitor users 24/7. Artificial intelligence can help people extend their knowledge and understanding of Medicine. Image-based AI diagnoses can help doctors better treat their patients.

AI in The Criminal Justice System
As crazy as it sounds, AI has already made it in the criminal justice system. Many police departments and courts are turning to artificial intelligence to mitigate bias. A machine now handles profiling and risk assessment. AI looks for patterns in criminal records and historical data to make a recommendation. The analysis should be free from racial, sexual, or other biases - in theory. There have been reports that AI is using data to send people to jail for the wrong reasons. Predicting a person has a "high risk" of future criminal activity without any context is wrong. It's like the movie "Minority Report," where people get arrested before they commit a crime. If the justice system is going to use AI for the long term, it has to be 100% vetted and accurate because lives are at stake. One welcome benefit of AI in the justice system is that the retrieval of information is going to be faster. Algorithms can help people check someoneâ€™s criminal background or any public documents online. Lines at the courthouse or police department will be shorter, putting less strain on police officers and court officials.

<font face="Times New Roman" size="14" color="#006E97 "/>Fears
<font size="4" color="#111F25 "/>Many people are afraid of AI becoming self-aware and wiping out humanity. For years, popular science fiction provided the backdrop for the public's knowledge of the technology. Movies such as The Terminator, I, Robot, and Ex-Machina all give a glimpse of what the future with AI could be like. A common theme among these stories is that artificial intelligence can be dangerous if left unchecked. The myths about AI becoming conscious and evil are wrong. Artificial intelligence will become competent, not evil, and its goals will be vastly different from that of humans. While the threat is real, there are safeguards in place to prevent an AI apocalypse from happening. We're many decades away from a super-intelligent machine, and for now, the benefits of AI far outweigh the risks involved.
